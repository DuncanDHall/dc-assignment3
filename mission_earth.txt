       Satire is not restricted to the western world. In fact, the Chinese character for the word 
can be translated as "laughter with knives." Meanwhile, the origin of our word satire is not as 
sharp. It comes from the Latin satura which meant "medley" or "mixture" and seems to have been 
part of the vocabulary of food to describe a hodge-podge assortment, a "mixture full of different 
things," such as a bowl of mixed first-of-the-season fruits. The essence of the word seemed to 
mean a simple dish of a down-to-earth variety that may have been common but it was hearty, 
healthy, satisfying and fun. 
       It was quite natural that satura came to be used for the popular, improvised skits that were 
performed before an undoubtedly boistrous Roman audience. There was no form or plot. Song, prose, 
verse and dialogue were enthusiastically mixed to entertain with praise and ridicule. 
       Thus when the father of Roman poetry, Quintus Ennius (c. 239-169 B.C.), chose to introduce 
the word satura for some of his poems, he probably borrowed from both uses and meant that his 
poems were a simple (but hearty and healthy), jocular mixture of drama and comedy that mimicked 
and entertained through prose, verse and song.
